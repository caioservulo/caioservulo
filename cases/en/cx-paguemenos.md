### 🎯 Overview
- **Context:** 2nd largest pharmaceutical retail group in Brazil, with 1,700+ physical stores, e-commerce/app sales, and telesales (22 million customers).
- **My Role:** Customer Experience Manager | SAC | Operations Products and Processes. Responsible for the execution strategy of the entire post-sales chain.
- **Timeline:** Comprehensive restructuring project.
- **Stack/Tools:** Omnichannel CRM, WhatsApp Business API, Data Analytics, CX/CS Indicators.

---

### 🔍 The Challenge
We identified a critical problem in the customer journey during post-sales service. The operation relied on legacy systems with no integration and non-standardized processes.
> "We identified that when calling the call center (SAC), only **13% of customers** were successfully served, causing high friction and loss of purchase recurrence."

---

### 🔧 Strategy and Solution
I performed a 360-degree analysis of the operation across 3 pillars: people, processes, and tools. The solution was divided into:

1. **Organizational Restructuring:** Redistribution of 5 coordination layers, aligning expectations and managing a team of 150+ people to reduce turnover.
2. **Financial Analysis:** Identified the correlation between **Service CSAT and increased purchase recurrence** (primarily web), which justified an immediate budget increase for the department.
3. **Digital Transformation:** Full implementation of an **integrated Omnichannel CRM**, where I acted as the direct PM for the new internal product, in addition to launching WhatsApp as a service channel.
4. **Data & CX Culture:** Implementation and management of key indicators (NPS, CSAT, TME, TMA, NS, AI, CES) and the creation of the *Client Insights* sub-area (Mystery Shopper, Focus Groups, and Life Cycle surveys).

### 📈 Results and Impact
The results represent the highest historical performance metrics for the company:

- **Service Volume:** **212% increase in the service rate** and a **264% increase in the volume of customers served/month**.
- **Service Level:** **843% increase in the historical Service Level (SL)** of the company.
- **Operational Efficiency:** **92% reduction in ASA** (Average Speed of Answer/TME) and **33% reduction in AHT** (Average Handle Time/TMA).
- **Customer Satisfaction:** **88% reduction in Customer Effort Score (CES)** and a **7.5% increase in the company's NPS**.
- **Reputation:** Achieved **RA-1000 seals** (top customer service certification in Brazil) for both brands in the group.
