### 🎯 Overview
- **Context:** SAS Educação (Arco Educação) – A leading educational SaaS platform in Brazil providing solutions for K-12 schools.
- **My Role:** Product Owner.
- **Timeline:** 1.5 years (intensive pandemic phase).
- **Stack/Tools:** Agile Methodologies, YouTube Live Streaming, High-Priority Backlog Management.

### 🔍 The Challenge
*With the physical closure of schools due to the pandemic, SAS's core product was directly impacted. The challenge was to create an immediate solution to maintain learning continuity and support students and schools during a global crisis.*
> "We needed to transform the teaching model in a matter of days, ensuring that high-quality education reached all grade levels, from elementary to pre-university students."

### 🔧 Strategy and Solution
*The evolution from a restricted platform to a democratized education model:*

1. **Pivot to Live Learning:** We identified that live classes were the most effective way to simulate the classroom environment and maintain both pedagogical and emotional connection.
2. **Content Scalability:** We expanded the initial strategy (which focused on a few grades) to cover the entire curriculum, from early childhood education to advanced high school levels.
3. **Open Content Strategy:** We made a strategic decision to open our content. Instead of restricting access only to partner schools, we launched free live classes on YouTube for the entire country, fulfilling a vital social role during the pandemic.
4. **War-Room Operation:** We built an infrastructure capable of supporting large-scale simultaneous broadcasts featuring an elite team of educators.

### 📈 Results and Impact
*The project became one of the largest digital education case studies in Brazil.*

- **Massive Reach:** Over **45 million total views** on the YouTube channel and peaks of **50,000 simultaneous students** during exam review sessions.
- **Retention & Stickiness:** The "Ao Vivo" project became a primary driver for Arco Educação's **retention rate of over 95%**, creating deep student engagement with the brand.
- **Pedagogical Excellence:** Contributed to over **1,400 annual Medical School admissions** and helped maintain SAS partner schools within the Top 100 national rankings.
- **Operational Scale:** Over 60 teachers operating in **36 simultaneous virtual classrooms**, 6 days a week, delivering 40+ hours of weekly live programming.
- **B2B Value Proposition:** Provided a high-level educational reinforcement that reduced indirect costs for school owners, who otherwise would have spent heavily on local specialized staff.
