### 🎯 Overview
- **Context:** Yampa – A Brazilian financial SaaS startup for SMBs transitioning into a complete business management ecosystem.
- **My Role:** Product Growth Manager & Data Strategist.
- **Timeline:** 9 days (MVP development).
- **Stack/Tools:** Low-code platforms, Cloud Databases, Benchmarking, Lean Inception.

---

### 🔍 The Challenge
*Develop and validate a new HR product for the Yampa ecosystem while minimizing the workload on the engineering team, which was focused on other strategic demands.*
> "The goal was to test a new business vertical quickly, reducing technical opportunity costs while validating market hypotheses."

### 🔧 Strategy and Solution
*How I validated a new ecosystem front independently:*

1. **Strategic Benchmarking:** Conducted a comprehensive mapping of competitors to analyze existing solutions and identify strategic differentiators for our product ecosystem.
2. **Lean Inception:** Facilitated a Lean Inception workshop with cross-functional teams to align on the initial product scope and testing vision.
3. **Product Design & Requirements:** Mapped core features and user flows, drafting detailed requirements and acceptance criteria.
4. **Low-code Development:** Built the platform within the defined scope using low-code tools integrated with cloud databases, operating independently from the engineering team.
5. **Stakeholder Alignment:** Presented the functional scope to the CEO and Directors of Product, Marketing, and Sales to align on the first wave of tests.

### 📈 Results and Impact
*Rapid validation and operational efficiency.*

- **Speed to Market:** Developed a testable product in a reduced scope in just **9 days**.
- **Engineering Efficiency:** **Zero impact** on the engineering team's capacity during the validation phase.
- **Strategic Approval:** 100% internal approval of the solution by business units and positive initial feedback from clients.
